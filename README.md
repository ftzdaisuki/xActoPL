# xActoPL

it's half past 1am as I type this, so obviously this is now going to be permanent

this is the repository for my tag-based photo library application called xActo (name as much of a WIP as the rest of the program). think like imageboard tags but all kept local to your computer. 

right now the program can create an empty database and you can import a folder of photos into it. theoretically it should populate a checklist of tags but I haven't actually implemented tagging pictures yet so that's still broken.

if you somehow think this even counts as "release", "beta", or even "alpha" quality software you need to raise your standards. this effectively does not work yet at all. 

when complete this program will be licensed under the MIT license. I'm just making this program because I want to use it and nobody else seems to have made anything else like it. if you wanna clone it and make it better than more power to you, just credit me where ya can.

this program is being written with heavy assistance from chatGPT. I believe I am doing so in what could be considered an "ethical" manner and I will upoad a video discussing this at a later date.

no I'm not porting this to any phones. will look into macOS/Linux remakes once we're feature-complete-ish though.

"test pictures" contains random pictures from my computer that I'm using as dummy files for testing. the unusual.fm domain is no longer controlled by me and I have no plans to renew it; browse to it at your own risk.
